A blockchain is basically an Immutable and Distributed Ledger. The ledger characteristic of blockchain is incorporated by letting newly mined blocks to execute and store the previously pending transactions, in return of which, the node that mines the block is rewarded with 12.5 Fiero Dimes by the creator of this project. Every block is validated by three parameters: Transactional Data, Timestamp, Index; Previous Blocks Hash Value; Nonce value calculated using Proof of Work Algorithm. As such, each blockchain begins with a header node called as Genesis Block whose nonce value is 100, hash value is 0 and hash value of previous block is 0 as well. With the help of broadcasting method, the three basic activities: transacting, mining and registering new nodes are synchronized well on an otherwise decentralized system. The blockchain can be statically validated while, Consensus Algorithm ensures that entire blockchain remains valid in real time, on the decentralized network.
